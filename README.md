# ComposeVerse: An Animated Solar System 🌌🚀✨

ComposeVerse is a high-performance Solar System simulation built entirely using **Jetpack Compose**
and **Canvas API**. It features a mesmerizing orbital dance of planets, dynamic space effects, and a
character-driven cosmic adventure.

## 🌟 Key Features

### 🔭 Celestial Mechanics

- **Precision Orbits**: All eight planets of our solar system simulated with accurate relative
  orbital radius and velocities.
- **Saturn's Rings**: A beautiful, semi-transparent ring system that tracks with the 6th planet.
- **Dynamic Scaling**: The entire system scales perfectly across all screen sizes and orientations.

### 🚀 Pilot Character & Adventure

- **The Cosmic Jump**: A character-led mission in a high-speed rocket, leaping from Earth towards
  the edge of the solar system (Neptune).
- **Responsive Character Logic**: The character communicates via a fancy multi-color speech bubble,
  reacting to milestones like "Ignition" and "Safe Landing"
- **Multi-Stage Rocket**: A detailed vector-drawn rocket featuring metallic panels, rivets,
  aerodynamic fins, and a flickering high-energy exhaust plume.

### 🎆 Visual & Atmospheric Effects

- **Space Nebulae**: Deep-space gas clouds with subtle pulse animations that add depth and color to
  the void.
- **Twinkling Starfield**: A background of 200+ stars, with a subset dynamically twinkling to create
  a living universe.
- **Shooting Stars**: Randomly generated meteor streaks that cross the screen at varying intervals.
- **Planetary Glow**: Each planet features a soft, atmospheric aurora glow that matches its unique
  color profile.

### 📱 Premium UX/UI

- **Responsive Typography**: The "ComposeVerse" title dynamically adjusts its positioning (Portrait
  vs. Landscape) for optimal visibility.
- **Haptic Feedback**: Integrated device haptics simulate the rumble of the rocket engine during the
  ignition and launch phase.
- **Modular Architecture**: Clean project structure separating data models, drawing utilities,
  constants, and system helpers.
